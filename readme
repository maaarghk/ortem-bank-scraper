screen scraper for "ortem" bank
-------------------------------

insert blurb / rant here about """""open""""" banking """""standards"""""  :eye roll emoj:


anyway so like i needed to do what the open standards ppl call "screen scraping"
so i could get my statement uploaded to my accounting software automatically

my accounting software is rightly banned from doing this itself because the
bastard services which used to offer this basically saved your password plain
text (as this does), but nothing stops me from doing it myself of course.

this is made difficult because of 2FA so first time run it not in headless mode
and it'll wait for you to manually enter the 2FA for 15 mins and finish.

I actually think the userdata workaround is probably not required because they
do some kind of fingerprinting and use that to configure the trusted device but
i think it can't hurt to persist cookies between sessions.

in any case we use it to store downloads.

run it non headless first time locally...
```
touch /tmp/.docker.xauth
xauth nlist $DISPLAY | sed -e 's/^..../ffff/' | xauth -f /tmp/.docker.xauth nmerge -
docker-compose build
docker-compose run puppeteer npm i
docker-compose run puppeteer
```


then you can stick something like run_and_post.php in cron

(probs should just return the "dry" filename so that run_and_post could be a
bash script but I was reusing old code)
